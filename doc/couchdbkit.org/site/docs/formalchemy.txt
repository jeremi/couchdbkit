title: Formalchemy extension
page_type: blog

For the "Django extension":/docs/django-extension.html I wrote the object `DocumentForm` that allows you to create a Django Form class based on a Document class or instance of a Document. 

But you don't need to use Django to have this facility in your web application. If you use "Pylons":http://pylonshq.com/ you already know "FormAlchemy":http://code.google.com/p/formalchemy/. FormAlchemy was originaly developped to map "SQLAlchemy":http://www.sqlalchemy.org/ object in form but it now contain an extension for Couchdbkit too. 

h2. How to use it?

Once again we have our Document `Greeting`

<pre class="code prettyprint">
 from couchdbkit import *
 
 class Greeting(Document):
     author = StringProperty()
     content = StringProperty(required=True)
     date = DateTimeProperty(default=datetimee.utcnow)
</pre>

The couchdbkit extension of FormAlchemy is in module `formalchemy.ext.couchdb`. To map our document to a FormAlchemy do : 

<pre class="code prettyprint">
 from formalchemy.ext.couchdb import FieldSet
 
 fs = FieldSet(Greeting)
 greet = Greeting(
     author="Benoit",
     content="Welcome to simplecouchdb world",
     date=datetime.datetime.utcnow()
 )
 fs = fs.bind(greet)
</pre>

And that's it.
