* Accessing to document id in `Document`object is now done by using `_id` member. The same for revision (now `_rev`). It liberate id and rev members. Since Django don't like get_id() and get_rev() poperties has been created to allow access to these properties in templates.
* Accept `unicode` instead str in `StringListProperty`
